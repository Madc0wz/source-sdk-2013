<p>(Logo Coming Soon!)
This site is the product of my 10 minutes of work that I have spent on this so far. The idea of this project was to introduce myself to the Source SDK. The ending product with hopefully be a coop/pvp zombie game or some thing like that. I am using HL2 source code. </p>

<p>I for the most part don't want help with the base game as the purpose was for me to intro myself to the source SDK. However I am always wanting for extra tips on the Source SDK as I have not used it before. I am also always wanting for people who model and want to give me an old project as I suck at design. Lastly I am always ready for new ideas and brainstormers to give me the ideas to match your image of the perfect game. (Zach, if you are reading this, goddamit).</p>
