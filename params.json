{"name":"Project-DamnitZach","tagline":"Me d*cking around trying stuff with the 2013 edition of the Source SDK","body":"\r\n\r\n### Welcome to Project-DamnitZach\r\n(Logo Coming Soon!)\r\n\r\nThis site is the product of my 10 minutes of work that I have spent on this so far. The idea of this project was to introduce myself to the Source SDK. The ending product with hopefully be a coop/pvp zombie game or some thing like that. I am using HL2 source code. \r\n\r\n### Cooperation\r\nI for the most part don't want help with the base game as the purpose was for me to intro myself to the source SDK. However I am always wanting for extra tips on the Source SDK as I have not used it before. I am also always wanting for people who design models and want to give me one or two as I suck at design. Lastly I am always ready for new ideas and brainstormers to give me the ideas to match your image of the perfect game. (Zach, if you are reading this, goddamit).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThanks to @JohnDrinkWater and the valve team for making the SDK available for people to use.
